<p><strong><a href="./2048/">2048/</a></strong> is my deterministic
version of Gabriele Cirulli's 2048 game derived from a game called
1024, itself derived from Three.  Click on the link to see the full
credentials.
</p>
<p>
  I present here some details that can be used to publish on your
  website a version that keep high scores, with the replay associated
  with it.  Since it is deterministic and there is no random involved,
  no cheating is possible: people can check the replay.
</p>
<p>
  First, we need to convert most efficiently the moves in a string.
  We could use compression algorithms implemented in javascript before
  sending to the server, but it turns out for most games (and maybe
  all of them) the compressed version takes even more space, so we
  just try to encode the moves in the smaller amount of characters
  possible.
</p>
<p>
  There is four possible moves at each step, which amounts to two
  bits.  We can fill up to eight bits a character, but that usually
  yields encoding problems.  We can try only six bits, giving three
  moves per characters, using one of
  the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64">base 64
  schemes</a>.  Several signs should be avoided, the "+" is one of
  them (because GET and POST requests encode spaces as plus signs, so
  they are interpreted in this way) and the default scheme uses a "+".
  We don't really consider that this encoding of moves should be a
  standard, so we just take our own encoding:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>var table64 = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789-/";
</code></pre> To convert a list of moves to a string, we iterate on
the string. One good thing is we don't need to bother about padding,
as a too long sequence will not be interpreted further:
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>var string_of_moves = function(moves) {
  while(moves.length%3)
    moves.push(0);
  n=moves.length;
  r = "";
  for(i = 0; i+2 &lt; n; i += 3) {
    s = 0;
    for(j = 0; j < 3; j++)
      s = s*4 + moves[i+j]%4;
    r += table64[s];
  }
  return r;
}
</code></pre> The code for unmarshaling back to a list of moves is
very simple as well. Note that in javascript you don't have euclidean
division by default, so you can use little tricks to recover it: when 
<code class="prettyprint">x</code>
is a floating-point number,
<code class="prettyprint">x|0</code> returns the corresponding
integer, the one with the smallest absolute value.  Of course, on
integer numbers this operation, (bitwise or with 0 bits) is the
identity function, so there is no problem here.  No further trikcs in
the following code:
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>var moves_of_string = function(s) {
  v = [];
  for(i = 0; i &lt; s.length; i++) {
    k = table64.indexOf(s[i]);
    v.push(k/16%4|0, k/4%4|0, k%4);
  }
  return v;
}
</code></pre>
